      <h2>Basic Information</h2>
      <p><strong>Stage Name:</strong> Lee Gai</p>
      <p><strong>Birth Name:</strong> Lee Ji Na</p>

      <h2>Joining Baby V.O.X</h2>
      <p>
        Lee Gai joined Baby V.O.X in 1998 during a period of lineup changes.
        At the time, the group was still stabilizing after its early debut years and several original members had already departed.
      </p>
      <p>
        She participated in group activities during this transitional phase and appeared as a member for approximately one year.
      </p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h2>The Controversy</h2>
      <p>
        In 1999, it was revealed that Lee Gai was significantly older than the age that had been publicly presented.
        While Baby V.O.X was marketed as a youthful girl group, her real age did not align with the group’s intended image.
      </p>
      <p>
        This discovery caused public backlash and media scrutiny, which ultimately led to her departure from the group.
        The situation became one of the most well-known early controversies in first-generation K-pop.

      <h2>After Leaving the Group</h2>
      <p>
        Following her exit from Baby V.O.X, Lee Gai withdrew from the public eye.
        She did not continue an idol career and has largely remained out of the entertainment industry since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike later generations, idols during this era had limited protections, and controversies often resulted in permanent career endings.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Lee Gai’s time in Baby V.O.X was brief, but her story remains an important part of the group’s history.
        It highlights the intense image standards and pressures placed on idols during the late 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, her inclusion in the group’s timeline is remembered as part of Baby V.O.X’s early struggles before achieving long-term stability.
