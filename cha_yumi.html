        Cha Yumi was one of the original members of Baby V.O.X at their debut in 1997.
        She held the position of main vocalist and was an important part of the group’s early sound.

      <h2>Injury and Departure</h2>
      <p>
        Not long after debut, Cha Yumi suffered a serious injury.
        Due to the physical demands of idol life and limited medical recovery options at the time,
        she was forced to leave the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many other lineup changes, her departure was not due to controversy or conflict,
        but simply because she could no longer continue performing.
      </p>
      <p>She is also notable for being the only Korean-American member of Baby V.O.X</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Cha Yumi is remembered by fans as a talented vocalist whose career ended far too early.

        where injuries often meant permanent endings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though her time in Baby V.O.X was brief, she remains an important part of the group’s origin story.
